// Problem 1: Addition of two numbers
$a = 5;
$b = 3;
$c = $a + $b; // c should be 8

// Problem 2: Multiplication of a number by itself
$x = 4; // x should be 16
$y = $x * $x; // y should be 16

// Problem 3: Finding the square root of a number (using math functions)
$number = 16;
$\sqrt{number} = sqrt($number); // $\sqrt{number}$ should be 4.0

// Problem 4: Calculating the difference between two numbers
$diff = 8 - 2; // diff should be 6

// Problem 5: Getting a random number (between 1 and 10)
$random_number = rand(1, 10); // random_number should be between 1 and 10 (inclusive)

// Problem 6: Finding the average of three numbers
$a = 7; $b = 4; $c = 2;
$\avg{a,b,c} = ($a + $b + $c) / 3; // $\avg{a,b,c}$ should be 5

// Problem 7: Checking if a number is divisible by another number (using division)
$divisible_by_10 = 10 % 2; // $divisible_by_10 should be 0
